            Now that the event is mere weeks away, it dawned on me that I've
            never actually done a bridal show booth before, or any booth for
            that matter. Yikes. Just as I was getting ready to hit the panic
            button, the ultra-talented Sarah Campbell from Intrigue Design
            invited me to her Annapolis studio to borrow props from her
            collection. Thank you, Jesus.

            When a creative-at-heart person such as myself invests fifteen years
            in the corporate world and then finally takes a leap of faith to
            start over where they really belong, getting the chance to tour an
            award-winning design studio is like heaven on earth. Not to mention,
            the opportunity to brainstorm with an expert like Sarah. Priceless.{" "}

            <br />I arrived in the morning and Sarah and her team were busy at
            work on their last big wedding of the year! White blooms for days.
            Just breathtaking.

          We included a custom branded double sided notecard with Coca-Cola's
          logo in white text. We love how the notecard coordinated perfectly
          with the Coca-Cola red ribbon and gift tag. <br />
